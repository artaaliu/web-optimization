This is my 4th Project in Udacity..

----

- To find this project here is my link in github: https://github.com/artaaliu/web-optimization/tree/master

- You can get it by clicking on "Download zip", and then extract on your computer, or by clicking "Clone or Download", and then on "Open in Desktop".

- After you get the folder on your computer, you can open the code on sublime text or whatever you use to do your code.

- To see the page what I had created, you need to open the index file on your browser(google chrome or mozilla etc..), you can open that by clicking on index.html file with right click and open that by clicking on "open by:", and you will see that on your browser.

----

- ** To run the project on your computer, you should open the index.html file on the folder**
- To see the code of it you should open that on your sublime or any text editor that you use.
- On that file you see that I did the most of th code to make it work,
- To inline the css I put the style css, <style>"I put the code from style.css here"</style>
- To the script tag I put the async < script async src="..." ></script> 
- I put the script tag on the and of the code,
- You can see the ul list wich has the list on my projects, 
- There are the images of the projects, and there is < a href="..."></a> to let you click on it and open the page of that project.
- But the last image will send you to the pizeria page, and there you will see the fake page of the pizzeria,
- And there you can see by scrolling down and up the pizza moving, and there you can see the line SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE
- By moving that you can make the size of the pizza smaller or medium or large.
